# Association-Rule-Based-Recommender-System

## Business Problem
Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive service. It provides easy access to services such as cleaning, renovation and transportation with a few touches on the computer or smart phone. It is desired to create a product recommendation system with Association Rule Learning by using the dataset containing the service users and the services and categories these users have received.

## Dataset Story
The dataset consists of the services customers receive and the categories of these services. It contains the date and time information of each service received.

## Project Tasks
* Preparing the Data
* Generating and Suggesting Association Rules

The dataset was not shared due to commercial confidentiality.
